<h1>Analyzing statistics of mileage</h1>
<p>
  I log car different metrics, now I hope to extract some information of there using statistics and R.
</p>
<p>
  As you see there are not a lot: driving to work and back, shops, classes and one day long run.

  So mileage is growing, which is sum of daily mileage.
</p>
<h2>1. Mean, Mode, Mediana</h2>
<p>
  Mean value is an average mileage I drive daily, in average. Note that usually extremum values are not included, but I let them matter to average.
  Trimmed mean is average daily milage without counting 10% of each extremum mileage (e.g. trims 1 highest and one lowest mileage from 10), and you can observe that trimmed mean is closer to median.
  Median is central tendency measure, which better represents daily mileage and not so driven by extremum values.

Lets now say I drive on weekdays more for important things, but on weekend I drive more for fun. Lets assume that priority is 85% / 15%.
Weighted average in this case will show what average milleage I spend for important things (greater than common average, as weekend drive is usualy not intensive).

<p>
  Quartiles shows how the mileage is distributed above and below the median.

<p>
  Standard deviation shows how much +/- kms from mean I drive usually.

<p>
  Can we already do some predictions on mileage? Yes, we have average daily and deviation.
